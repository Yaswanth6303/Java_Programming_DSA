/**
 * Maximum Consecutive Ones
 *
 * Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.
 *
 * A binary array is an array that contains only 0s and 1s.
 *
 * Example 1
 * Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The maximum consecutive 1s are present from index 4 to index 6, amounting
 * to 3 1s
 *
 * Example 2
 * Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: No 1s are present in nums, thus we return 0
 *
 * Example 3
 * Input: nums = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
 *
 * Note:
 * Follow up: What if you were asked to return the maximum consecutive 1 or 0, whichever is
 * more?
