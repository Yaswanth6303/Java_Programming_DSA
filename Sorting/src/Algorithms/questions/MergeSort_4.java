/**
 * Merge Sorting
 *
 * Given an array of integers, nums,sort the array in non-decreasing order using the
 * merge sort algorithm. Return the sorted array.
 *
 * A sorted array in non-decreasing order is one in which each element is either greater
 * than or equal to all the elements to its left in the array.
 *
 * Example 1
 * Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]
 * Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
 * Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.
 * Thus, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * Example 2
 * Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]
 * Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]
 * Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.
 * Thus, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * Example 3
 * Input: nums = [3, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * Output: [2, 3, 3, 4, 5]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^6
 * -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * nums[i] may contain duplicate values.
 *
 * Note:
 * It is advised to avoid any in-built sorting functions.
